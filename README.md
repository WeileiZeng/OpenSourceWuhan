# OpenSourceWuhan --> Open Source COVID-19

As of March 7, I changed the name from OpenSourceWuhan to Open Source COVID-19. You can visit the [new repo](https://weileizeng.github.io/Open-Source-COVID-19/) and the [new website](https://github.com/WeileiZeng/Open-Source-COVID-19). The original website still works, but will be redirect to the new one.

Reason for name changing: The COVID-19 firstly became severe in Wuhan, that is why every one related it this way. However, now it is a global event, with the name COVID-19 defined by WHO. It is more approporiate to refer it use the official name. From the other hand, our project focus on global effort in the open source community. The local city Wuhan doesn't fully reflect our project. The third reason is that there is some viral discussion on the internet about relating this name to either Wuhan or China. With this, we decided to changed the name.
